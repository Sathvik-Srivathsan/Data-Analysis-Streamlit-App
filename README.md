# Data Analyst Agent

A Streamlit app to chat with your documents. Upload a file and ask the AI to analyze, summarize, or create visualizations from it.

## Setup

### Install Libraries:

    pip install streamlit pandas pypdf python-docx openpyxl replicate

### Add API Key:

        Create a folder named .streamlit (note the leading dot) in your project's root directory.

        Inside this .streamlit folder, put the file named secrets.toml.

        Open secrets.toml and add your Replicate API token in the following format:

        REPLICATE_API_TOKEN="your_token_here"

        (Replace "your_token_here" with your actual Replicate API token.)

### Run

    streamlit run app.py

## Code Explanation

    Analyst.py: Contains the main Streamlit application logic.

    Page Configuration: st.set_page_config defines the app's title and layout.

    API Key Integration: Retrieves REPLICATE_API_TOKEN securely using st.secrets for Replicate API calls.

    File Processing: Functions (process_text, process_pdf, etc.) handle parsing various document types (.txt, .pdf, .docx, .csv, .xlsx).

    Visualization Execution: execute_viz_code runs Python code blocks (generated by the LLM) to render charts with plotly.express.

    query_replicate_llama3: Interfaces with the Replicate API, sending data context and chat history to the Llama 3 model for AI responses.

    Chat Interface: Manages and displays user and assistant messages, including the execution of any detected visualization code.
